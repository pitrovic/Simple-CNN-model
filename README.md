#	Steps :
1.	Collect and preprocess the data: The first step is to collect a dataset of images and preprocess them to prepare them for training the model. This involves resizing the images to a common size, converting them to grayscale or RGB format, and normalizing the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.
2.	Build a model: The next step is to build a model that can learn to classify the images using convolutional neural network (CNN).
3.	Train the model: Once the model is built, the next step is to train it on the dataset. This involves feeding the training images through the model and adjusting the modelâ€™s parameters to minimize the error between the predicted and true labels.
4.	Evaluate the model: After the model is trained, the next step is to evaluate its performance on a separate test dataset. This involves measuring the accuracy of the model in predicting the correct labels for the test images.
